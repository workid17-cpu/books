## Opening

1. **Quote:** "In the previous chapter, we saw how prompt engineering can do wonders for the accuracy of your text-generation large language model (LLM). With just a few small tweaks, these LLMs are guided toward more purposeful and accurate answers. This showed how much there is to gain using techniques that do not fine-tune the LLM but instead use the LLM more efficiently, such as the relatively straightforward prompt engineering."
   - **Plain English:** Prompt engineering boosts LLM accuracy without fine-tuning by using the model more efficiently.
   - **Word meanings:** tweaks = small adjustments; purposeful = goal-directed.
   - **Technical terms:** prompt engineering; text-generation LLM; fine-tune.

2. **Quote:** "In this chapter, we will continue this train of thought. What can we do to further enhance the experience and output that we get from the LLM without needing to fine-tune the model itself?"
   - **Plain English:** The chapter keeps improving LLM output while avoiding fine-tuning.
   - **Word meanings:** enhance = improve.
   - **Technical terms:** fine-tune.

3. **Quote:** "Fortunately, a great deal of methods and techniques allow us to further improve what we started with in the previous chapter. These more advanced techniques lie at the foundation of numerous LLM-focused systems and are, arguably, one of the first things users implement when designing such systems."
   - **Plain English:** Many advanced techniques underpin real LLM systems and are often early building blocks.
   - **Word meanings:** arguably = possibly/debatably; foundation = base.
   - **Technical terms:** LLM-focused systems.

4. **Quote:** "In this chapter, we will explore several such methods and concepts for improving the quality of the generated text: Model I/O (Loading and working with LLMs), Memory (Helping LLMs to remember), Agents (Combining complex behavior with external tools), Chains (Connecting methods and modules)."
   - **Plain English:** The chapter covers four techniques: Model I/O, Memory, Agents, and Chains.
   - **Technical terms:** Model I/O; Memory; Agents; Chains.

5. **Quote:** "These methods are all integrated with the LangChain framework that will help us easily use these advanced techniques throughout this chapter. LangChain is one of the earlier frameworks that simplify working with LLMs through useful abstractions. Newer frameworks of note are DSPy and Haystack. Some of these abstractions are illustrated in Figure 7-1. Note that retrieval will be discussed in the next chapter."
   - **Plain English:** LangChain (with newer alternatives DSPy and Haystack) provides abstractions to combine these techniques; retrieval is next chapter.
   - **Word meanings:** abstractions = simplified high-level interfaces; of note = worth mentioning.
   - **Technical terms:** LangChain; DSPy; Haystack; retrieval.

6. **Quote:** "Each of these techniques has significant strengths by themselves but their true value does not exist in isolation. It is when you combine all of these techniques that you get an LLM-based system with incredible performance. The culmination of these techniques is truly where LLMs shine."
   - **Plain English:** The techniques work best combined into full LLM systems.
   - **Word meanings:** culmination = the peak/result; isolation = alone.
   - **Technical terms:** LLM-based system.

### Model I/O: Loading Quantized Models with LangChain

7. **Quote:** "Before we can make use of LangChain's features to extend the capabilities of LLMs, we need to start by loading our LLM. As in previous chapters, we will be using Phi-3 but with a twist; we will use a GGUF model variant instead. A GGUF model represents a compressed version of its original counterpart through a method called quantization, which reduces the number of bits needed to represent the parameters of an LLM."
   - **Plain English:** Load Phi-3 as a GGUF (quantized/compressed) model instead of the standard version.
   - **Word meanings:** twist = change; counterpart = original version.
   - **Technical terms:** GGUF; quantization; parameters.

8. **Quote:** "Bits, a series of 0s and 1s, represent values by encoding them in binary form. More bits result in a wider range of values but requires more memory to store those values, as shown in Figure 7-2."
   - **Plain English:** Bits store values in binary; more bits = more precision/range but more memory.
   - **Word meanings:** encoding = representing; binary = base-2.
   - **Technical terms:** bits; binary.

9. **Quote:** "Figure 7-2. Attempting to represent pi with float 32-bit and float 16-bit representations. Notice the lowered accuracy when we halve the number of bits."
   - **Plain English:** Halving the bit width (32→16) lowers the precision with which a value like pi can be stored.
   - **Technical terms:** float 32-bit; float 16-bit.

10. **Quote:** "Quantization reduces the number of bits required to represent the parameters of an LLM while attempting to maintain most of the original information. This comes with some loss in precision but often makes up for it as the model is much faster to run, requires less VRAM, and is often almost as accurate as the original."
    - **Plain English:** Quantization shrinks models: less precision but faster, less VRAM, nearly as accurate.
    - **Word meanings:** makes up for = compensates.
    - **Technical terms:** quantization; precision; VRAM.

11. **Quote:** "To illustrate quantization, consider this analogy. If asked what the time is, you might say '14:16,' which is correct but not a fully precise answer. You could have said it is '14:16 and 12 seconds' instead, which would have been more accurate. However, mentioning seconds is seldom helpful and we often simply put that in discrete numbers, namely full minutes. Quantization is a similar process that reduces the precision of a value (e.g., removing seconds) without removing vital information (e.g., retaining hours and minutes)."
    - **Plain English:** Like giving the time to the minute (not seconds): drop unneeded precision, keep vital info.
    - **Word meanings:** analogy = comparison; seldom = rarely; discrete = separate/whole.
    - **Technical terms:** quantization; precision.

12. **Quote:** "In Chapter 12, we will further discuss how quantization works under the hood. You can also see a full visual guide to quantization in 'A Visual Guide to Quantization' by Maarten Grootendorst. For now, it is important to know that we will use an 8-bit variant of Phi-3 compared to the original 16-bit variant, cutting the memory requirements almost in half."
    - **Plain English:** 8-bit Phi-3 ≈ half the memory of the 16-bit version; deeper details in Chapter 12.
    - **Word meanings:** under the hood = internal mechanics.
    - **Technical terms:** 8-bit; 16-bit; memory requirements.

13. **Quote (note):** "As a rule of thumb, look for at least 4-bit quantized models. These models have a good balance between compression and accuracy. Although it is possible to use 3-bit or even 2-bit quantized models, the performance degradation becomes noticeable and it would instead be preferable to choose a smaller model with a higher precision."
    - **Plain English:** Prefer ≥4-bit quantization; below that, choose a smaller but higher-precision model instead.
    - **Word meanings:** rule of thumb = practical guideline; degradation = decline.
    - **Technical terms:** quantization; precision.

14. **Quote:** "First, we will need to download the model. Note that the link contains multiple files with different bit-variants. FP16, the model we choose, represents the 16-bit variant."
    - **Plain English:** The download link holds several bit-variants; we pick FP16 (16-bit).
    - **Word meanings:** variants = versions.
    - **Technical terms:** FP16; bit-variants; GGUF.

### Code Block 1: Downloading the GGUF model
```bash
!wget https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf/resolve/main/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-fp16.gguf
```
- **Explanation:** Downloads the FP16 (16-bit) GGUF quantized Phi-3 from the `microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf` Hugging Face repo.
- **Fits the architecture:** GGUF is the file format for quantized models that llama-cpp-python loads.

15. **Quote:** "We use llama-cpp-python together with LangChain to load the GGUF file."
    - **Plain English:** llama-cpp-python (with LangChain) loads the compressed model.
    - **Technical terms:** llama-cpp-python; LangChain; GGUF.

### Code Block 2: Loading the GGUF model with LangChain
```python
from langchain import LlamaCpp
# Make sure the model path is correct for your system!
llm = LlamaCpp(
    model_path="Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-fp16.gguf",
    n_gpu_layers=-1,
    max_tokens=500,
    n_ctx=2048,
    seed=42,
    verbose=False
)
```
- **Explanation:** `n_gpu_layers=-1` = all layers on GPU; `max_tokens=500` = generation cap; `n_ctx=2048` = context window; `seed=42` = reproducible; `verbose=False` = quiet logs.
- **Fits the architecture:** Replaces the transformers pipeline for quantized model inference.

16. **Quote:** "In LangChain, we use the invoke function to generate output."
    - **Plain English:** `invoke` is LangChain's generation call.
    - **Technical terms:** invoke.

### Code Block 3: Invoking the raw LLM (no output)
```python
llm.invoke("Hi! My name is Maarten. What is 1 + 1?")
# ''
```
- **Explanation:** Empty output — Phi-3 needs its chat template which we must supply ourselves.
- **Fits the architecture:** Motivates building chains with a PromptTemplate.

17. **Quote:** "Unfortunately, we get no output! As we have seen in previous chapters, Phi-3 requires a specific prompt template. Compared to our examples with transformers, we will need to explicitly use a template ourselves. Instead of copy-pasting this template each time we use Phi-3 in LangChain, we can use one of LangChain's core functionalities, namely 'chains.'"
    - **Plain English:** Phi-3 needs its template; chains let us define it once instead of copy-pasting.
    - **Word meanings:** explicitly = directly/clearly; functionality = feature.
    - **Technical terms:** prompt template; chains.

18. **Quote (note):** "All examples in this chapter can be run with any LLM. This means that you can choose whether to use Phi-3, ChatGPT, Llama 3 or anything else when going through the examples. We will use Phi-3 as a default throughout, but the state-of-the-art changes quickly, so consider using a newer model instead. You can use the Open LLM Leaderboard (a ranking of open source LLMs) to choose whichever works best for your use case."
    - **Plain English:** Examples are LLM-agnostic; Phi-3 is the default but swap in anything, guided by the Open LLM Leaderboard.
    - **Technical terms:** Open LLM Leaderboard; open source LLMs.

19. **Quote (note):** "If you do not have access to a device that can run LLMs locally, consider using ChatGPT instead."
    - **Plain English:** No local GPU → use a hosted API model like ChatGPT.
    - **Technical terms:** local LLM; hosted API.

### Code Block 4: Fallback chat model
```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
# Create a chat-based LLM
chat_model = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key="MY_KEY")
```
- **Explanation:** Uses OpenAI's chat API (placeholder API key) when no local device is available.
- **Fits the architecture:** Shows models are swappable in the same examples.

### Chains: Extending the Capabilities of LLMs

20. **Quote:** "LangChain is named after one of its main methods, chains. Although we can run LLMs in isolation, their power is shown when used with additional components or even when used in conjunction with each other. Chains not only allow for extending the capabilities of LLMs but also for multiple chains to be connected together."
    - **Plain English:** Chains connect LLMs to components or other LLMs; multiple chains can link.
    - **Word meanings:** conjunction = combination; isolation = alone.
    - **Technical terms:** chains.

21. **Quote:** "The most basic form of a chain in LangChain is a single chain. Although a chain can take many forms, each with a different complexity, it generally connects an LLM with some additional tool, prompt, or feature. This idea of connecting a component to an LLM is illustrated in Figure 7-3."
    - **Plain English:** A basic chain = an LLM + an extra component (tool, prompt, feature).
    - **Technical terms:** single chain; prompt; tool.

22. **Quote:** "In practice, chains can become complex quite quickly. We can extend the prompt template however we want and we can even combine several separate chains together to create intricate systems. In order to thoroughly understand what is happening in a chain, let's explore how we can add Phi-3's prompt template to the LLM."
    - **Plain English:** Chains scale up: extend templates or combine chains into intricate systems.
    - **Word meanings:** intricate = complex/elaborate.
    - **Technical terms:** prompt template; chains.

### A Single Link in the Chain: Prompt Template

23. **Quote:** "We start with creating our first chain, namely the prompt template that Phi-3 expects. In the previous chapter, we explored how transformers.pipeline applies the chat template automatically. This is not always the case with other packages and they might need the prompt template to be explicitly defined. With LangChain, we will use chains to create and use a default prompt template. It also serves as a nice hands-on experience with using prompt templates."
    - **Plain English:** transformers auto-applies chat templates, but LangChain needs one defined via chains.
    - **Word meanings:** hands-on = practical.
    - **Technical terms:** transformers.pipeline; chat template; prompt template; chains.

24. **Quote:** "The idea, as illustrated in Figure 7-4, is that we chain the prompt template together with the LLM to get the output we are looking for. Instead of having to copy-paste the prompt template each time we use the LLM, we would only need to define the user and system prompts."
    - **Plain English:** Chain the template to the LLM once; afterwards just supply user/system prompts.
    - **Technical terms:** prompt template; user prompt; system prompt.

25. **Quote:** "The template for Phi-3 is comprised of four main components: <s> to indicate when the prompt starts; <|user|> to indicate the start of the user's prompt; <|assistant|> to indicate the start of the model's output; <|end|> to indicate the end of either the prompt or the model's output."
    - **Plain English:** The four Phi-3 template tokens mark prompt start, user text, model output, and end.
    - **Technical terms:** `<s>`; `<|user|>`; `<|assistant|>`; `<|end|>`.

### Code Block 5: Creating a prompt template (single chain)
```python
from langchain import PromptTemplate
# Create a prompt template with the "input_prompt" variable
template = """<s><|user|>
{input_prompt}<|end|>
<|assistant|>"""
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=template,
    input_variables=["input_prompt"]
)
```
- **Explanation:** Defines Phi-3's expected template with one variable, `input_prompt`, where the user's question is inserted.
- **Fits the architecture:** The template is the first modular component chained to the LLM.

### Code Block 6: Chaining prompt and LLM
```python
basic_chain = prompt | llm
```
- **Explanation:** The pipe operator (`|`) chains the prompt and LLM into `basic_chain`.
- **Fits the architecture:** The most basic chain: component → LLM.

### Code Block 7: Using the chain
```python
# Use the chain
basic_chain.invoke(
    {
        "input_prompt": "Hi! My name is Maarten. What is 1 + 1?",
    }
)
# The answer to 1 + 1 is 2. It's a basic arithmetic operation...
```
- **Explanation:** `invoke` with the `input_prompt` variable yields a clean response.
- **Fits the architecture:** No need to reconstruct the template each call.

26. **Quote:** "The output gives us the response without any unnecessary tokens. Now that we have created this chain, we do not have to create the prompt template from scratch each time we use the LLM. Note that we did not disable sampling as before, so your output might differ."
    - **Plain English:** Clean output; template is reusable; output varies because sampling isn't disabled.
    - **Word meanings:** from scratch = from nothing.
    - **Technical terms:** sampling; tokens.

27. **Quote (note):** "The example assumes that the LLM needs a specific template. This is not always the case. With OpenAI's GPT-3.5, its API handles the underlying template."
    - **Plain English:** Not every model needs an explicit template — GPT-3.5's API handles it.
    - **Technical terms:** template; API.

28. **Quote (note):** "You could also use a prompt template to define other variables that might change in your prompts. For example, if we want to create funny names for businesses, retyping that question over and over for different products can be time-consuming."
    - **Plain English:** Templates make repetitive prompts reusable via variables.
    - **Word meanings:** time-consuming = slow/tedious.
    - **Technical terms:** prompt template; variables.

### Code Block 8: Reusable business-name prompt
```python
# Create a Chain that creates our business' name
template = "Create a funny name for a business that sells {product}."
name_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=template,
    input_variables=["product"]
)
```
- **Explanation:** A prompt with a `{product}` variable so it works for any product.
- **Fits the architecture:** Prompt templates handle any changing variable.

29. **Quote:** "Adding a prompt template to the chain is just the very first step you need to enhance the capabilities of your LLM. Throughout this chapter, we will see many ways in which we can add additional modular components to existing chains, starting with memory."
    - **Plain English:** Templates are only the start; more modular components (memory, etc.) come next.
    - **Technical terms:** modular components; memory.

### A Chain with Multiple Prompts

30. **Quote:** "In our previous example, we created a single chain consisting of a prompt template and an LLM. Since our example was quite straightforward, the LLM had no issues dealing with the prompt. However, some applications are more involved and require lengthy or complex prompts to generate a response that captures those intricate details."
    - **Plain English:** Simple chains work, but complex applications need longer prompts.
    - **Word meanings:** involved = complicated; intricate = detailed.
    - **Technical terms:** single chain.

31. **Quote:** "Instead, we could break this complex prompt into smaller subtasks that can be run sequentially. This would require multiple calls to the LLM but with smaller prompts and intermediate outputs as shown in Figure 7-7."
    - **Plain English:** Split complex prompts into sequential subtasks (multiple LLM calls, intermediate outputs).
    - **Word meanings:** sequentially = one after another.
    - **Technical terms:** subtasks; sequential; intermediate outputs.

32. **Quote:** "This process of using multiple prompts is an extension of our previous example. Instead of using a single chain, we link chains where each link deals with a specific subtask."
    - **Plain English:** Sequential chains: each link handles one subtask.
    - **Technical terms:** link; subtask; sequential chains.

33. **Quote:** "For instance, consider the process of generating a story. We could ask the LLM to generate a story along with complex details like the title, a summary, a description of the characters, etc. Instead of trying to put all of that information into a single prompt, we could dissect this prompt into manageable smaller tasks instead."
    - **Plain English:** Story generation (title, summary, characters) is easier as separate tasks than one prompt.
    - **Word meanings:** dissect = break apart.
    - **Technical terms:** sequential chains.

34. **Quote:** "Let's illustrate with an example. Assume that we want to generate a story that has three components: A title, A description of the main character, A summary of the story. Instead of generating everything in one go, we create a chain that only requires a single input by the user and then sequentially generates the three components."
    - **Plain English:** Three story components are generated sequentially from a single user input.
    - **Word meanings:** in one go = all at once.
    - **Technical terms:** chain; components.

### Code Block 9: Title chain (first link of the sequential chain)
```python
from langchain import LLMChain
# Create a chain for the title of our story
template = """<s><|user|>
Create a title for a story about {summary}. Only return the title.<|end|>
<|assistant|>"""
title_prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["summary"])
title = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=title_prompt, output_key="title")
```
- **Explanation:** The first link takes `{summary}` as input; its output is stored under the key `"title"`.
- **Fits the architecture:** `LLMChain` + `output_key` name the output so later links can reference it.

35. **Quote:** "To generate that story, we use LangChain to describe the first component, namely the title. This first link is the only component that requires some input from the user. We define the template and use the 'summary' variable as the input variable and 'title' as the output. We ask the LLM to 'Create a title for a story about {summary}' where '{summary}' will be our input."
    - **Plain English:** The title link is the only one needing user input; `{summary}` in, `title` out.
    - **Word meanings:** namely = that is.
    - **Technical terms:** input variable; output; link.

### Code Block 10: Running the title chain
```python
title.invoke({"summary": "a girl that lost her mother"})
# {'summary': 'a girl that lost her mother',
#  'title': ' "Whispers of Loss: A Journey Through Grief"'}
```
- **Explanation:** Returns both the input (`summary`) and generated `title`.
- **Fits the architecture:** Demonstrates intermediate outputs available from decomposed tasks.

36. **Quote:** "This already gives us a great title for the story! Note that we can see both the input ('summary') as well as the output ('title')."
    - **Plain English:** Good title; the chain returns both input and output.
    - **Technical terms:** input; output.

### Code Block 11: Character chain (second link)
```python
# Create a chain for the character description using the summary and title
template = """<s><|user|>
Describe the main character of a story about {summary} with the title {title}. 
Use only two sentences.<|end|>
<|assistant|>"""
character_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=template, input_variables=["summary", "title"]
)
character = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=character_prompt, output_key="character")
```
- **Explanation:** The second link uses `{summary}` and the previous `{title}` to describe the character, output key `"character"`.
- **Fits the architecture:** Sequential chains feed earlier outputs into later prompts.

37. **Quote:** "Let's generate the next component, namely the description of the character. We generate this component using both the summary as well as the previously generated title. Making sure that the chain uses those components, we create a new prompt with the {summary} and {title} tags."
    - **Plain English:** The character link consumes both summary and title.
    - **Technical terms:** components; tags/variables.

38. **Quote:** "Although we could now use the character variable to generate our character description manually, it will be used as part of the automated chain instead."
    - **Plain English:** The character output feeds the automated chain rather than manual use.
    - **Technical terms:** automated chain; variable.

### Code Block 12: Story chain (third link)
```python
# Create a chain for the story using the summary, title, and character descrip
tion
template = """<s><|user|>
Create a story about {summary} with the title {title}. The main character is: 
{character}. Only return the story and it cannot be longer than one paragraph. 
<|end|>
<|assistant|>"""
story_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=template, input_variables=["summary", "title", "character"]
)
story = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=story_prompt, output_key="story")
```
- **Explanation:** The final link uses all three variables (`summary`, `title`, `character`) and stores its output under `"story"`.
- **Fits the architecture:** The last link depends on every previous output.

39. **Quote:** "Let's create the final component, which uses the summary, title, and character description to generate a short description of the story."
    - **Plain English:** The story link combines summary, title, and character to write the story.
    - **Technical terms:** components.

### Code Block 13: Combining the chains
```python
# Combine all three components to create the full chain
llm_chain = title | character | story
```
- **Explanation:** Pipes the three LLMChains together so outputs flow forward automatically.
- **Fits the architecture:** Sequential (multi-prompt) chain; user supplies one input.

### Code Block 14: Running the full story chain
```python
llm_chain.invoke("a girl that lost her mother")
# {'summary': 'a girl that lost her mother',
#  'title': ' "In Loving Memory: A Journey Through Grief"',
#  'character': ' The protagonist, Emily, is a resilient young girl ...',
#  'story': " In Loving Memory: A Journey Through Grief revolves around Emily, ..."}
```
- **Explanation:** One short input produces title, character, and story; each is separately accessible.
- **Fits the architecture:** Decomposition gives access to individual components.

40. **Quote:** "Running this chain gives us all three components. This only required us to input a single short prompt, the summary. Another advantage of dividing the problem into smaller tasks is that we now have access to these individual components. We can easily extract the title; that might not have been the case if we were to use a single prompt."
    - **Plain English:** Decomposition yields all components and easy access to each (e.g., extracting the title).
    - **Technical terms:** components; extract.

### Memory: Helping LLMs to Remember Conversations

41. **Quote:** "When we are using LLMs out of the box, they will not remember what was being said in a conversation. You can share your name in one prompt but it will have forgotten it by the next prompt."
    - **Plain English:** Default LLMs forget prior conversation content.
    - **Word meanings:** out of the box = as-is/default.
    - **Technical terms:** conversation; prompt.

42. **Quote:** "Let's illustrate this phenomenon with an example using the basic_chain we created before. First, we tell the LLM our name."
    - **Plain English:** Demo: tell the LLM your name, then check recall.
    - **Technical terms:** basic_chain.

43. **Quote:** "Next, we ask it to reproduce the name we have given it. ... Unfortunately, the LLM does not know the name we gave it. The reason for this forgetful behavior is that these models are stateless—they have no memory of any previous conversation!"
    - **Plain English:** The LLM forgets your name because models are stateless (no prior-conversation memory).
    - **Word meanings:** reproduce = repeat back; stateless = no retained state.
    - **Technical terms:** stateless; memory.

44. **Quote:** "To make these models stateful, we can add specific types of memory to the chain that we created earlier. In this section, we will go through two common methods for helping LLMs to remember conversations: Conversation buffer; Conversation summary."
    - **Plain English:** Add memory to chains to make models stateful; two methods: conversation buffer and conversation summary.
    - **Word meanings:** stateful = retains state.
    - **Technical terms:** stateful; Conversation buffer; Conversation summary; chain.

### Conversation Buffer

45. **Quote:** "One of the most intuitive forms of giving LLMs memory is simply reminding them exactly what has happened in the past. As illustrated in Figure 7-10, we can achieve this by copying the full conversation history and pasting that into our prompt."
    - **Plain English:** Buffer memory = append the entire past conversation into the prompt.
    - **Word meanings:** intuitive = easy to grasp.
    - **Technical terms:** conversation history; prompt.

46. **Quote:** "In LangChain, this form of memory is called a ConversationBufferMemory. Its implementation requires us to update our previous prompt to hold the history of the chat."
    - **Plain English:** LangChain's ConversationBufferMemory needs the prompt to include a history slot.
    - **Technical terms:** ConversationBufferMemory; chat history.

### Code Block 15: Conversation buffer prompt with chat history
```python
template = """<s><|user|>Current conversation:{chat_history}
{input_prompt}<|end|>
<|assistant|>"""
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=template,
    input_variables=["input_prompt", "chat_history"]
)
```
- **Explanation:** Adds the `chat_history` input variable where the memory injects prior conversation.
- **Fits the architecture:** The prompt now has a place for memory content.

47. **Quote:** "Notice that we added an additional input variable, namely chat_history. This is where the conversation history will be given before we ask the LLM our question."
    - **Plain English:** `chat_history` holds past conversation, inserted before the new question.
    - **Technical terms:** input variable; chat_history.

### Code Block 16: ConversationBufferMemory chain
```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
# Define the type of memory we will use
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")
# Chain the LLM, prompt, and memory together
llm_chain = LLMChain(
    prompt=prompt,
    llm=llm,
    memory=memory
)
```
- **Explanation:** Creates buffer memory keyed to `chat_history`, then chains LLM + prompt + memory.
- **Fits the architecture:** The memory module automatically fills the `chat_history` variable with the full history.

48. **Quote:** "Next, we can create LangChain's ConversationBufferMemory and assign it to the chat_history input variable. ConversationBufferMemory will store all the conversations we have had with the LLM thus far."
    - **Plain English:** Buffer memory stores every conversation so far under the `chat_history` key.
    - **Word meanings:** thus far = up to now.
    - **Technical terms:** ConversationBufferMemory; memory_key.

### Code Block 17: First conversation with memory
```python
llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt": "Hi! My name is Maarten. What is 1 + 1?"})
# {'input_prompt': 'Hi! My name is Maarten. What is 1 + 1?',
#  'chat_history': '',
#  'text': " Hello Maarten! The answer to 1 + 1 is 2. Hope you're having a great day!"}
```
- **Explanation:** `text` = generated output; `chat_history` empty on first call.
- **Fits the architecture:** Output now includes the memory-managed history field.

49. **Quote:** "You can find the generated text in the 'text' key, the input prompt in 'input_prompt', and the chat history in 'chat_history'. Note that since this is the first time we used this specific chain, there is no chat history."
    - **Plain English:** Output dict keys: `text`, `input_prompt`, `chat_history` (empty on first use).
    - **Technical terms:** keys; chat_history.

### Code Block 18: Follow-up question (memory recall)
```python
llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt": "What is my name?"})
# {'input_prompt': 'What is my name?',
#  'chat_history': "Human: Hi! My name is Maarten. What is 1 + 1?\nAI:  Hello Maarten! ...",
#  'text': ' Your name is Maarten.'}
```
- **Explanation:** With history injected, the model recalls the name.
- **Fits the architecture:** LangChain stores turns as `Human:`/`AI:` roles.

50. **Quote:** "By extending the chain with memory, the LLM was able to use the chat history to find the name we gave it previously. This more complex chain is illustrated in Figure 7-11 to give an overview of this additional functionality."
    - **Plain English:** Memory lets the LLM retrieve the earlier name from history.
    - **Technical terms:** memory; chat history; chain.

### Windowed Conversation Buffer

51. **Quote:** "In our previous example, we essentially created a chatbot. You could talk to it and it remembers the conversation you had thus far. However, as the size of the conversation grows, so does the size of the input prompt until it exceeds the token limit."
    - **Plain English:** Buffer memory works but prompts grow to the token limit as conversations lengthen.
    - **Word meanings:** essentially = basically.
    - **Technical terms:** token limit; prompt size.

52. **Quote:** "One method of minimizing the context window is to use the last k conversations instead of maintaining the full chat history. In LangChain, we can use ConversationBufferWindowMemory to decide how many conversations are passed to the input prompt."
    - **Plain English:** Windowed memory keeps only the last k conversations to limit context size.
    - **Technical terms:** context window; ConversationBufferWindowMemory; k.

### Code Block 19: Windowed conversation buffer
```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory
# Retain only the last 2 conversations in memory
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=2, memory_key="chat_history")
# Chain the LLM, prompt, and memory together
llm_chain = LLMChain(
    prompt=prompt,
    llm=llm,
    memory=memory
)
```
- **Explanation:** `k=2` keeps only the last two conversations in `chat_history`.
- **Fits the architecture:** Trade-off: smaller prompts but older info lost.

53. **Quote:** "Using this memory, we can try out a sequence of questions to illustrate what will be remembered. We start with two conversations."
    - **Plain English:** Demo sequence to show what the window remembers.
    - **Technical terms:** sequence; window.

### Code Block 20: Two conversations to build window history
```python
llm_chain.predict(input_prompt="Hi! My name is Maarten and I am 33 years old. What is 1 + 1?")
llm_chain.predict(input_prompt="What is 3 + 3?")
```
- **Explanation:** Uses `predict` (shorthand invoke) to create two conversations: one with name+age, one simple math.
- **Fits the architecture:** `predict` fills the prompt's input variables directly.

54. **Quote:** "The interaction we had thus far is shown in 'chat_history'. Note that under the hood, LangChain saves it as an interaction between you (indicated with Human) and the LLM (indicated with AI)."
    - **Plain English:** History is stored as `Human:` (user) and `AI:` (model) turns.
    - **Word meanings:** under the hood = internally.
    - **Technical terms:** chat_history; Human; AI.

### Code Block 21: Checking remembered name with window memory
```python
llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt":"What is my name?"})
# 'chat_history': "Human: Hi! My name is Maarten and I am 33 years old. ...\nAI: ...\nHuman: What is 3 + 3?\nAI: ...",
# 'text': ' Your name is Maarten, as mentioned at the beginning of our conversation.'
```
- **Explanation:** The window now holds the last two interactions (name+age, then 3+3); the model still knows the name.
- **Fits the architecture:** Window memory retains the last k interactions verbatim.

55. **Quote:** "Based on the output in 'text' it correctly remembers the name we gave it. Note that the chat history is updated with the previous question."
    - **Plain English:** Name is remembered; history is updated after each turn.
    - **Technical terms:** chat history; window.

56. **Quote:** "Now that we have added another conversation we are up to three conversations. Considering the memory only retains the last two conversations, our very first question is not remembered."
    - **Plain English:** After three conversations, the first is dropped (window keeps only the last two).
    - **Technical terms:** window; k.

### Code Block 22: Checking forgotten age with window memory
```python
llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt":"What is my age?"})
# 'chat_history': "Human: What is 3 + 3?\nAI: ...\nHuman: What is my name?\nAI: Your name is Maarten.",
# 'text': " I'm unable to determine your age ... unless you choose to share it."
```
- **Explanation:** The first conversation (with age 33) is no longer in the window, so the model doesn't know the age.
- **Fits the architecture:** Illustrates windowed memory's limitation (only last k retained).

57. **Quote:** "Although this method reduces the size of the chat history, it can only retain the last few conversations, which is not ideal for lengthy conversations. Let's explore how we can summarize the chat history instead."
    - **Plain English:** Windowed buffer shrinks history but loses old content; summary memory is the alternative.
    - **Word meanings:** ideal = best; lengthy = long.
    - **Technical terms:** chat history; Conversation Summary.

### Conversation Summary

58. **Quote:** "As we have discussed previously, giving your LLM the ability to remember conversations is vital for a good interactive experience. However, when using ConversationBufferMemory, the conversation starts to increase in size and will slowly approach your token limit. Although ConversationBufferWindowMemory resolves the issue of token limits to an extent, only the last k conversations are retained."
    - **Plain English:** Buffer grows toward token limits; windowed keeps only last k — both imperfect.
    - **Word meanings:** vital = essential; to an extent = partially.
    - **Technical terms:** ConversationBufferMemory; token limit; ConversationBufferWindowMemory.

59. **Quote:** "Although a solution would be to use an LLM with a larger context window, these tokens still need to be processed before generation tokens, which can increase compute time. Instead, let's look toward a more sophisticated technique, ConversationSummaryMemory. As the name implies, this technique summarizes an entire conversation history to distill it into the main points."
    - **Plain English:** Bigger context windows cost compute; ConversationSummaryMemory summarizes the whole history instead.
    - **Word meanings:** sophisticated = advanced; distill = condense.
    - **Technical terms:** context window; ConversationSummaryMemory; summarization.

60. **Quote:** "This summarization process is enabled by another LLM that is given the conversation history as input and asked to create a concise summary. A nice advantage of using an external LLM is that we are not confined to using the same LLM during conversation."
    - **Plain English:** A separate LLM summarizes the history; it need not be the same model as the conversation model.
    - **Word meanings:** concise = brief; confined = limited.
    - **Technical terms:** summarization LLM; external LLM.

61. **Quote:** "This means that whenever we ask the LLM a question, there are two calls: The user prompt; The summarization prompt."
    - **Plain English:** Every question triggers two calls: the answer call and a summarization call.
    - **Technical terms:** user prompt; summarization prompt.

### Code Block 23: ConversationSummaryMemory — summary prompt template
```python
summary_prompt_template = """<s><|user|>Summarize the conversations and update 
with the new lines.
Current summary:
{summary}
new lines of conversation:
{new_lines}
New summary:<|end|>
<|assistant|>"""
summary_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["new_lines", "summary"],
    template=summary_prompt_template
)
```
- **Explanation:** The summarization prompt takes a `{summary}` and `{new_lines}` and asks the LLM to output an updated `New summary`.
- **Fits the architecture:** This template drives the second (summarization) call.

62. **Quote:** "To use this in LangChain, we first need to prepare a summarization template that we will use as the summarization prompt."
    - **Plain English:** Build the summarization template first.
    - **Technical terms:** summarization template; summarization prompt.

### Code Block 24: ConversationSummaryMemory chain
```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory
# Define the type of memory we will use
memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(
    llm=llm, 
    memory_key="chat_history", 
    prompt=summary_prompt
)
# Chain the LLM, prompt, and memory together
llm_chain = LLMChain(
    prompt=prompt,
    llm=llm,
    memory=memory
)
```
- **Explanation:** Summary memory needs an extra `llm` (the summarizer) plus the `summary_prompt`. The chapter uses the same LLM for both; a smaller model could speed summarization.
- **Fits the architecture:** History is summarized before being inserted into the prompt.

63. **Quote:** "Using ConversationSummaryMemory in LangChain is similar to what we did with the previous examples. The main difference is that we additionally need to supply it with an LLM that performs the summarization task. Although we use the same LLM for both summarizing and user prompting, you could use a smaller LLM for the summarization task to speed up computation."
    - **Plain English:** The difference vs other memories: supply a summarization LLM; a smaller one speeds it up.
    - **Technical terms:** ConversationSummaryMemory; summarization task; LLM.

### Code Block 25: Testing the summary memory
```python
llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt": "Hi! My name is Maarten. What is 1 + 1?"})
llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt": "What is my name?"})
# 'chat_history': ' Summary: Human, identified as Maarten, asked the AI about 
# the sum of 1 + 1, which was correctly answered by the AI as 2 ...'
```
- **Explanation:** After each step the conversation is summarized; the summary appears in `chat_history`.
- **Fits the architecture:** The prompt receives a compact summary, not raw history.

64. **Quote:** "After each step, the chain will summarize the conversation up until that point. Note how the first conversation was summarized in 'chat_history' by creating a description of the conversation."
    - **Plain English:** Each step regenerates the summary covering everything so far.
    - **Technical terms:** summarize; chat_history.

### Code Block 26: Continuing the conversation and checking the summary
```python
llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt": "What was the first question I asked?"})
# 'chat_history': ' Summary: Human, identified as Maarten ... first asked about 
# the sum of 1 + 1 ... Later, Maarten inquired about their name ...'
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```
- **Explanation:** The summary grows to include later turns; `load_memory_variables({})` retrieves the current summary.
- **Fits the architecture:** The model infers the first question from the summary context.

65. **Quote:** "To get the most recent summary, we can access the memory variable we created previously."
    - **Plain English:** Read the latest summary via the memory object.
    - **Technical terms:** memory variable; load_memory_variables.

66. **Quote:** "This summarization helps keep the chat history relatively small without using too many tokens during inference. However, since the original question was not explicitly saved in the chat history, the model needed to infer it based on the context. This is a disadvantage if specific information needs to be stored in the chat history. Moreover, multiple calls to the same LLM are needed, one for the prompt and one for the summarization. This can slow down computing time."
    - **Plain English:** Summary keeps history small, but specific details must be inferred (not stored verbatim) and two calls slow things down.
    - **Word meanings:** infer = deduce; explicitly = verbatim/directly.
    - **Technical terms:** inference; summarization; compute time.

67. **Quote:** "Often, it is a trade-off between speed, memory, and accuracy. Where ConversationBufferMemory is instant but hogs tokens, ConversationSummaryMemory is slow but frees up tokens to use. Additional pros and cons of the memory types we have explored thus far are described in Table 7-1."
    - **Plain English:** Memory choice is a speed/memory/accuracy trade-off: buffer instant but token-hungry; summary slow but token-efficient.
    - **Word meanings:** hogs = consumes heavily; frees up = makes available.
    - **Technical terms:** ConversationBufferMemory; ConversationSummaryMemory; Table 7-1.

### Table 7-1 (memory types pros/cons)
68. **Conversation Buffer:** Pros — Easiest implementation; ensures no information loss within context window. Cons — Slower generation speed as more tokens are needed; only suitable for large-context LLMs; larger chat histories make information retrieval difficult.
69. **Windowed Conversation Buffer:** Pros — Large-context LLMs are not needed unless chat history is large; no information loss over the last k interactions. Cons — Only captures the last k interactions; no compression of the last k interactions.
70. **Conversation Summary:** Pros — Captures the full history; enables long conversations; reduces tokens needed to capture full history. Cons — An additional call is necessary for each interaction; quality is reliant on the LLM's summarization capabilities.

### Agents: Creating a System of LLMs

71. **Quote:** "Thus far, we have created systems that follow a user-defined set of steps to take. One of the most promising concepts in LLMs is their ability to determine the actions they can take. This idea is often called agents, systems that leverage a language model to determine which actions they should take and in what order."
    - **Plain English:** Unlike fixed step chains, agents let the LLM decide which actions to take and in what order.
    - **Word meanings:** leverage = use; promising = showing potential.
    - **Technical terms:** agents; language model; actions.

72. **Quote:** "Agents can make use of everything we have seen thus far, such as model I/O, chains, and memory, and extend it further with two vital components: Tools that the agent can use to do things it could not do itself; The agent type, which plans the actions to take or tools to use."
    - **Plain English:** Agents build on model I/O, chains, memory plus two components: tools and the agent type.
    - **Word meanings:** vital = essential.
    - **Technical terms:** tools; agent type; model I/O; chains; memory.

73. **Quote:** "Unlike the chains we have seen thus far, agents are able to show more advanced behavior like creating and self-correcting a roadmap to achieve a goal. They can interact with the real world through the use of tools. As a result, these agents can perform a variety of tasks that go beyond what an LLM is capable of in isolation."
    - **Plain English:** Agents plan and self-correct a roadmap and use tools to interact with the world, beyond an LLM alone.
    - **Word meanings:** roadmap = plan of steps; in isolation = by itself.
    - **Technical terms:** agents; tools.

74. **Quote:** "For example, LLMs are notoriously bad at mathematical problems and often fail at solving simple math-based tasks but they could do much more if we provide access to a calculator. As illustrated in Figure 7-14, the underlying idea of agents is that they utilize LLMs not only to understand our query but also to decide which tool to use and when."
    - **Plain English:** LLMs are weak at math; a calculator tool fixes that. Agents decide which tool to use and when.
    - **Word meanings:** notoriously = famously/knowingly.
    - **Technical terms:** tools; calculator; agents.

75. **Quote:** "In this example, we would expect the LLM to use the calculator when it faces a mathematical task. Now imagine we extend this with dozens of other tools, like a search engine or a weather API. Suddenly, the capabilities of LLMs increase significantly."
    - **Plain English:** Add many tools (search, weather API) and LLM capabilities grow dramatically.
    - **Word meanings:** significantly = greatly.
    - **Technical terms:** tools; search engine; weather API.

76. **Quote:** "In other words, agents that make use of LLMs can be powerful general problem solvers. Although the tools they use are important, the driving force of many agent-based systems is the use of a framework called Reasoning and Acting (ReAct)."
    - **Plain English:** LLM agents are general problem solvers; ReAct is the driving framework.
    - **Word meanings:** driving force = main driver.
    - **Technical terms:** agents; ReAct (Reasoning and Acting).

### The Driving Power Behind Agents: Step-by-step Reasoning

77. **Quote:** "ReAct is a powerful framework that combines two important concepts in behavior: reasoning and acting. LLMs are exceptionally powerful when it comes to reasoning as we explored in detail in Chapter 5."
    - **Plain English:** ReAct combines reasoning (LLMs are strong here) and acting.
    - **Word meanings:** exceptionally = extremely.
    - **Technical terms:** ReAct; reasoning; acting.

78. **Quote:** "Acting is a bit of a different story. LLMs are not able to act like you and I do. To give them the ability to act, we could tell an LLM that it can use certain tools, like a weather forecasting API. However, since LLMs can only generate text, they would need to be instructed to use specific queries to trigger the forecasting API."
    - **Plain English:** LLMs can't act directly; they must be instructed to emit specific tool-triggering queries.
    - **Word meanings:** trigger = initiate.
    - **Technical terms:** tools; weather forecasting API; text generation.

79. **Quote:** "ReAct merges these two concepts and allows reasoning to affect acting and actions to affect reasoning. In practice, the framework consists of iteratively following these three steps: Thought; Action; Observation."
    - **Plain English:** ReAct loops: Thought → Action → Observation, with reasoning and acting influencing each other.
    - **Word meanings:** iteratively = repeatedly; merges = combines.
    - **Technical terms:** ReAct; Thought; Action; Observation.

80. **Quote:** "Illustrated in Figure 7-15, the LLM is asked to create a 'thought' about the input prompt. This is similar to asking the LLM what it thinks it should do next and why. Then, based on the thought, an 'action' is triggered. The action is generally an external tool, like a calculator or a search engine. Finally, after the results of the 'action' are returned to the LLM it 'observes' the output, which is often a summary of whatever result it retrieved."
    - **Plain English:** Thought (what to do and why) → Action (external tool call) → Observation (result summary fed back).
    - **Technical terms:** Thought; Action; Observation; external tool.

81. **Quote:** "To illustrate with an example, imagine you are on holiday in the United States and interested in buying a MacBook Pro. Not only do you want to know the price but you need it converted to EUR as you live in Europe and are more comfortable with those prices."
    - **Plain English:** Example: find a MacBook Pro price in USD and convert to EUR.
    - **Technical terms:** currency conversion; exchange rate.

82. **Quote:** "As illustrated in Figure 7-16, the agent will first search the web for current prices. It might find one or more prices depending on the search engine. After retrieving the price, it will use a calculator to convert USD to EUR assuming we know the exchange rate."
    - **Plain English:** Agent searches for the price, then converts USD→EUR with a calculator.
    - **Technical terms:** search engine; calculator; exchange rate.

83. **Quote:** "During this process, the agent describes its thoughts (what it should do), its actions (what it will do), and its observations (the results of the action). It is a cycle of thoughts, actions, and observations that results in the agent's output."
    - **Plain English:** The agent narrates thoughts/actions/observations in a cycle ending in its final output.
    - **Technical terms:** thoughts; actions; observations; cycle.

### ReAct in LangChain

84. **Quote:** "To illustrate how agents work in LangChain, we are going to build a pipeline that can search the web for answers and perform calculations with a calculator. These autonomous processes generally require an LLM that is powerful enough to properly follow complex instructions."
    - **Plain English:** Build a web-search + calculator agent; needs a strong instruction-following LLM.
    - **Word meanings:** autonomous = self-directed.
    - **Technical terms:** pipeline; autonomous processes; complex instructions.

85. **Quote:** "The LLM that we used thus far is relatively small and not sufficient to run these examples. Instead, we will be using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model as it follows these complex instructions more closely."
    - **Plain English:** The small Phi-3 isn't enough for agents; use GPT-3.5.
    - **Technical terms:** GPT-3.5; complex instructions.

### Code Block 27: Loading OpenAI for agents
```python
import os
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
# Load OpenAI's LLMs with LangChain
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "MY_KEY"
openai_llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)
```
- **Explanation:** Loads GPT-3.5 with temperature 0 (deterministic tool use); API key placeholder.
- **Fits the architecture:** Agents need a stronger LLM to follow the ReAct template reliably.

86. **Quote (note):** "Although the LLM we used throughout the chapter is insufficient for this example, it does not mean that only OpenAI's LLMs are. Larger useful LLMs exist but they require significantly more compute and VRAM. For instance, local LLMs often come in different sizes and within a family of models, increasing a model's size leads to better performance. To keep the necessary compute at a minimum, we choose a smaller LLM throughout the examples in this chapter."
    - **Plain English:** Other (larger local) LLMs could work but cost more compute/VRAM; within a family, bigger = better.
    - **Word meanings:** insufficient = not enough.
    - **Technical terms:** compute; VRAM; model size.

87. **Quote (note):** "However, as the field of generative models evolves, so do these smaller LLMs. We would be anything but surprised if eventually smaller LLMs, like the one used in this chapter, would be capable enough to run this example."
    - **Plain English:** Smaller models will likely soon run agent examples too.
    - **Word meanings:** evolves = develops.
    - **Technical terms:** generative models; smaller LLMs.

88. **Quote:** "After doing so, we will define the template for our agent. As we have shown before, it describes the ReAct steps it needs to follow."
    - **Plain English:** Define the ReAct template that describes the steps.
    - **Technical terms:** ReAct template.

### Code Block 28: The ReAct template
```python
react_template = """Answer the following questions as best you can. You have 
access to the following tools:
{tools}
Use the following format:
Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
Begin!
Question: {input}
Thought:{agent_scratchpad}"""
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=react_template,
    input_variables=["tools", "tool_names", "input", "agent_scratchpad"]
)
```
- **Explanation:** The template lists tools and enforces the Question/Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation loop, ending in a Final Answer. Variables: `tools`, `tool_names`, `input`, `agent_scratchpad`.
- **Fits the architecture:** This is the ReAct prompting framework inside LangChain.

89. **Quote:** "This template illustrates the process of starting with a question and generating intermediate thoughts, actions, and observations."
    - **Plain English:** The template drives the question → thoughts/actions/observations → answer flow.
    - **Technical terms:** intermediate thoughts; actions; observations.

### Code Block 29: Defining the tools
```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools, Tool
from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchResults
# You can create the tool to pass to an agent
search = DuckDuckGoSearchResults()
search_tool = Tool(
    name="duckduck",
    description="A web search engine. Use this to as a search engine for gen
eral queries.",
    func=search.run,
)
# Prepare tools
tools = load_tools(["llm-math"], llm=openai_llm)
tools.append(search_tool)
```
- **Explanation:** Wraps DuckDuckGo search in a `Tool` (name "duckduck", description, run function) and adds a math/calculator tool via `load_tools(["llm-math"], llm=openai_llm)`.
- **Fits the architecture:** Tools let the agent act on the real world (search + calculator).

90. **Quote:** "To have the LLM interact with the outside world, we will describe the tools it can use."
    - **Plain English:** Tools are how the LLM interacts with the outside world.
    - **Technical terms:** tools; LLM.

91. **Quote:** "The tools include the DuckDuckGo search engine and a math tool that allows it to access a basic calculator."
    - **Plain English:** The agent gets DuckDuckGo search + a calculator math tool.
    - **Technical terms:** DuckDuckGo search engine; math tool; calculator.

### Code Block 30: Creating the ReAct agent and executor
```python
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_react_agent
# Construct the ReAct agent
agent = create_react_agent(openai_llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True, handle_parsing_errors=True
)
```
- **Explanation:** Builds the ReAct agent from LLM + tools + template and wraps it in an AgentExecutor that runs the loop. `verbose=True` prints intermediate steps; `handle_parsing_errors=True` tolerates malformed output.
- **Fits the architecture:** The executor drives the Thought/Action/Observation cycle.

92. **Quote:** "Finally, we create the ReAct agent and pass it to the AgentExecutor, which handles executing the steps."
    - **Plain English:** The AgentExecutor executes the agent's steps.
    - **Technical terms:** ReAct agent; AgentExecutor.

### Code Block 31: Invoking the agent
```python
agent_executor.invoke(
    {
        "input": "What is the current price of a MacBook Pro in USD? How much 
would it cost in EUR if the exchange rate is 0.85 EUR for 1 USD."
    }
)
```
- **Explanation:** The agent searches for the price and converts USD→EUR automatically.
- **Fits the architecture:** The agent decides tool order (search, then math).

93. **Quote:** "While executing, the model generates multiple intermediate steps similar to the steps illustrated in Figure 7-17. These intermediate steps illustrate how the model processes the ReAct template and what tools it accesses. This allows us to debug issues and explore whether the agent uses the tools correctly."
    - **Plain English:** Intermediate steps make tool usage visible, aiding debugging.
    - **Technical terms:** intermediate steps; ReAct template; debug.

### Code Block 32: Agent output
```python
{'input': 'What is the current price of a MacBook Pro in USD? ...',
 'output': 'The current price of a MacBook Pro in USD is $2,249.00. It would 
cost approximately 1911.65 EUR with an exchange rate of 0.85 EUR for 1 USD.'}
```
- **Explanation:** Final output: $2,249.00 USD ≈ 1,911.65 EUR at 0.85 EUR/USD.
- **Fits the architecture:** Search + calculator produce a combined answer.

94. **Quote:** "Considering the limited tools the agent has, this is quite impressive! Using just a search engine and a calculator the agent could give us an answer."
    - **Plain English:** Impressive result from just search + calculator.
    - **Word meanings:** impressive = noteworthy.
    - **Technical terms:** search engine; calculator.

95. **Quote:** "Whether that answer is actually correct should be taken into account. By creating this relatively autonomous behavior, we are not involved in the intermediate steps. As such, there is no human in the loop to judge the quality of the output or reasoning process."
    - **Plain English:** Autonomous agents have no human in the loop to check quality.
    - **Word meanings:** autonomous = self-directed.
    - **Technical terms:** human in the loop; reasoning process.

96. **Quote:** "This double-edged sword requires a careful system design to improve its reliability. For instance, we could have the agent return the website's URL where it found the MacBook Pro's price or ask whether the output is correct at each step."
    - **Plain English:** Design safeguards (e.g., return source URL, verify each step) to improve reliability.
    - **Word meanings:** double-edged sword = has pros and cons.
    - **Technical terms:** system design; reliability.

## Summary

97. **Quote:** "In this chapter, we explored several ways to extend the capabilities of LLMs by adding modular components. We began by creating a simple but reusable chain that connected the LLM with a prompt template. We then expanded on this concept by adding memory to the chain, which allowed the LLM to remember conversations.
